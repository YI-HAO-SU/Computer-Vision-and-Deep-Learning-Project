# Computer-Vision-and-Deep-Learning-Project
"The proposed system encompasses a comprehensive computer vision application with multifaceted capabilities, including camera calibration, augmented reality implementation, generation of stereo disparity maps, and the utilization of Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT). Additionally, the system involves deep learning tasks, specifically the training of a CIFAR-10 classifier. For this purpose, the well-established VGG19 architecture, enhanced with Batch Normalization (BN), is employed as the underlying framework for robust model training and classification tasks.
